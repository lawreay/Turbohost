# TurboHostMw

TurboHostMw is a custom PHP web hosting application for creating, managing, editing, publishing, and monitoring customer websites. It is built as a small MVC framework on top of native PHP and MySQL, with project storage, public publishing, file management, admin tools, and WordPress provisioning support.

## What this app does

The platform allows a signed-in user to:

- create a website project
- choose a starter template or WordPress project
- edit files in a draft workspace
- preview files before publishing
- publish to a public site folder
- manage uploaded files and folders
- track usage and site status
- receive notifications and manage billing/admin tasks

The public-facing website includes landing pages, pricing, FAQs, legal pages, login/register flows, and support pages.

## Technology stack

- PHP 8+ with a custom MVC structure
- MySQL database
- Sessions and cookie-based remember me flows
- PHPMailer for email delivery
- Apache/public folder hosting pattern
- Flat file storage under `storage/projects` and published sites under `public/sites`

## Application architecture

The app is organized into a lightweight MVC structure:

- `app/Controllers` contains HTTP handlers
- `app/Models` contains database-access logic for entities like users and websites
- `app/Services` contains business logic such as auth, publishing, notifications, storage, payments, and WordPress provisioning
- `app/Core` contains the framework pieces such as routing, sessions, validation, database access, and view rendering
- `app/Views` holds the template files for dashboard, marketing pages, email content, and administrative screens
- `app/Config` contains route registration, environment config, and startup settings

The app bootstraps in `index.php`, which loads the app and runs the router.

## Request lifecycle

1. The browser requests a route.
2. `index.php` starts the application.
3. `App::run()` loads config and routes.
4. Session handling and remember-me login logic run.
5. The router matches the request path and method.
6. A controller method executes the action.
7. Services perform business logic and database access.
8. A view renders HTML, or a response redirect is issued.

## Routing

Routes are defined in `app/Config/routes.php`.

Examples include:

- marketing pages: `/`, `/pricing`, `/contact`
- auth: `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`
- dashboard: `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/websites`
- file management: `/dashboard/websites/files`
- publishing: `/dashboard/websites/publish`
- admin: `/admin`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/settings`

## Configuration

The main runtime config lives in:

- `app/Config/app.php`
- `app/Config/constants.php`
- `app/Config/routes.php`
- `.env` for environment-specific values such as database and email settings

The app reads environment values via the `env()` helper defined in `app/Config/constants.php`.

Important: production secrets should never be committed to Git. The project includes `.env.example` as the safe template, and `.env` should be kept only on the server or hosting panel.

## Database

The schema is defined in `database/schema.sql` and related SQL files under `database/`.

Core tables include:

- `users`
- `websites`
- `files`
- `subscriptions`
- `payments`
- `analytics`

`app/Models` wraps the SQL logic for each domain object and keeps database work out of the controllers.

## Storage model

The project saves draft content in a user/project-based folder structure:

- `storage/projects/{userId}/{slug}` for active draft content
- `public/sites/{projectId}/{slug}` for published static content or WordPress output

The storage service manages safe path creation, path sanitization, file creation, folder creation, and directory size checks.

## Feature overview

### 1. Authentication and account management

Handled by controllers in `app/Controllers/AuthController.php` and services such as:

- `AuthService`
- `EmailVerificationService`
- `PasswordResetService`
- `TwoFactorService`

The app supports:

- registration
- login and logout
- remember-me cookies
- password reset
- email verification
- two-factor authentication

### 2. Website creation and draft management

The `WebsiteController` creates a project record, creates a safe storage folder, and then prepares the requested starter content.

For static sites, it creates a new `index.html` draft.
For WordPress sites, it installs a WordPress archive into the project folder and writes a generated `wp-config.php` file.

### 3. File manager

`FileManagerController` manages:

- uploading files
- creating folders and files
- moving items
- deleting items
- downloading/exporting project content
- ZIP import/export

The file management logic keeps operations inside the project directory and uses sanitization so invalid paths do not escape the project root.

### 4. Editor

The editor lets a user open text-based project files and save them back.

This is implemented via:

- `EditorController`
- `ProjectStorageService`
- `Website` model

The editor updates both the file content and the cached storage usage.

### 5. Publishing

`PublishingService` publishes a draft project to the public site location.

It:

- validates the draft path
- clears the public output folder
- copies approved files to the live public folder
- writes WordPress-specific `.htaccess` rules when needed
- leaves static projects restricted to safe static extensions

This keeps public files separate from editable draft storage.

### 6. WordPress support

WordPress installs are handled by `ProjectStorageService::installWordPress()`.

The installer:

- resolves the package path
- verifies the package checksum
- checks the archive for unsafe paths and symbolic links
- extracts into a temporary directory
- validates required WordPress files exist
- writes the generated configuration
- moves the final installation into the project directory

This reduces the risk of partially installed or maliciously crafted WordPress packages.

### 7. Notifications

The notifier system sends user alerts for events such as:

- account actions
- website creation
- payment changes
- admin broadcasts

The relevant logic lives in `app/Services/NotificationManager.php` and related notification controllers.

### 8. Admin tools

Admin routes allow an admin user to:

- view dashboard metrics
- manage users
- moderate websites
- review payments
- manage notifications and settings
- publish legal policies

### 9. Payments and plans

Payments are handled through the `PaymentController` and related services. The app tracks user plans and website limits via the `Website` model and `PlanService`.

### 10. SEO and legal pages

The app includes:

- sitemap generation
- legal pages such as privacy and terms
- policy acceptance flow

## Local development setup

### Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL
- Apache or Nginx with URL rewriting enabled
- Composer

### Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your local values.
3. Create the database and import `database/schema.sql`.
4. Install PHP dependencies if needed:

```bash
composer install
```

5. Configure your local web server to point to the project root or `public` directory based on your hosting pattern.
6. Start the app and visit the local URL.

## Security notes

This project is a hosting app and handles customer content, so remember to:

- never commit real production secrets
- keep `.env` out of version control
- validate paths before writing files
- restrict project publishing and output folders
- use strong server-side security for uploaded content
- keep WordPress packages verified and isolated

## Recommended next improvements

The app already has a strong foundation, and the next improvements that make it production-safe are:

- separate WordPress database credentials per site
- stricter user/site isolation
- more explicit WordPress lifecycle states
- stronger backup and restore strategy
- more granular deployment and environment validation

## Maintainer guidance

When working on this project:

- keep business logic in `app/Services`
- keep HTTP handling in `app/Controllers`
- keep SQL in `app/Models`
- keep presentations in `app/Views`
- keep route registration centralized in `app/Config/routes.php`

This keeps the codebase easier to extend and safer to maintain.
